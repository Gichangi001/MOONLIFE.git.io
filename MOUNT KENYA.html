Mount Kenya is a stratovolcano that was formed millions of years ago. The mountain has three main peaks: Batian, Nelion, and Lenana, with Batian being the highest at 5,199 meters (17,057 feet) above sea level. The mountain is part of the Mount Kenya National Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</P>

Mount Kenya is a popular destination for hikers and climbers, with several routes to the summit. The most popular routes are the Naro Moru route, the Sirimon route, and the Chogoria route. Hikers and climbers can also explore the mountain's diverse flora and fauna, including the giant groundsel and the unique equatorial snow.</P>

The local Kikuyu people consider Mount Kenya a sacred place, and it plays an important role in their traditional beliefs and ceremonies. The mountain also has cultural significance for other Kenyan communities, including the Embu, Meru, and Maasai.</P>
